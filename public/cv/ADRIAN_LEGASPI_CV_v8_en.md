## Summary

Senior web developer with over 10 years of experience delivering responsive, high-performance applications using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and cloud platforms.
In recent years, I've focused on integrating AI capabilities into web applications—applying Large Language Models (LLMs) through APIs (OpenAI, local models) and building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using LangChain and Supabase.
I have hands-on experience fine-tuning small open-source LLMs (e.g., TinyLlama, Mistral) using LoRA and QLoRA techniques for internal tools and assistant prototypes.
I approach every project with a strong focus on software architecture—designing scalable, modular systems that are built to evolve.
Committed to writing maintainable code and building solutions that optimize workflows and user experience.
